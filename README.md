## [Deployed Version](https://make-resources.herokuapp.com)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Installation and Requirements

Requirements:

```bash
python3
pipenv
```

Installation:

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tempor1s/make-resources.git
# cd into the project
cd make-resources
# create a virtual environment and install the required packages
pipenv shell
pipenv install
```

Congrats you should now have a working install of Make Resources

### Running The Project Locally

If you have not yet followed the installation steps, go and do so before continuing.

Once you have everything installed, you need to rename `.env.example` to `.env` and populate the fields with real data.

```bash
# cd into the src folder
cd make_resources
# rename .env.example to .env
mv .env.example .env
# populate the .env file with correct data
vim .env
```

Once you have renamed the `.env` file and populate it with correct data, all you need to do is run the server!

```bash
# run the the server
python3 manage.py runserver
# navigate to the url to see your running application!
http://localhost:8000
```
