Make Resources is going to be a twitter clone that allows only Make School students to 'tweet' on it and these 'tweets' are going to be resources. It will essentially just be a a place for all Make School students to share resources that they find! It will be useful because it will be a central place for students to share any resources that they find through their time at Make School. I know this is personally useful because I have a bunch of resources that I would like to share but do not have a centralized place to do it.
